# RecurrentNeuralNetwork
Artificial Intelligence has gained a lot of popularity in the last few years. Artificial Intelligence has helped humans to make their life easier and better optimize their time and energy. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence and deep learning is a subset of machine leaning. When it comes to future prediction, complex networks are required which can learn different aspects from the dataset. These networks comes under the category of Artificial Neural Network(ANN). There are different types of ANN like Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and so on. This paper talks about Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). Multiple experiments were performed to find the best hyperparametes and the best architecture of the model. Later a robust network was developed.
